# Vaccine-DBMS

This project provides the information about ‘Covid-19 Vaccine Data’.

This allows storage and management of details of all users. User’s details like Id, Name, Age, Vaccine Name, Dose, Status are stored in ‘Mysql’ database.

Details can be added, updated or deleted based on user’s requirement. Displaying all the selected records is also possible if required.
